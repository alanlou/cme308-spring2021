# CME 308: Stochastic Methods in Engineering (Spring 2021)



This repository contains my personal note for [CME 308: Stochastic Methods in Engineering](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cme308/)

### Course Description

This graduate level course is intended to give students a broad sense of the different mathematical and computational tools and models available to analyze systems in which uncertainty is present. The key ideas underlying stochastic analysis will be presented and illustrated using various applications chosen from engineering, the physical sciences, and economics. This course is intended both to introduce students to the subject matter at an advanced level and to offer an entry point into the many other high-level stochastics courses that Stanford offers.



### Prerequisites

Students should have a reasonable background in real variables (e.g. limits, epsilon-delta arguments, etc) and linear algebra (e.g. vector spaces, matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalization). In addition, I will be assuming that students enter the class with some basic preparation in probability (Knowledge of sample space, events, probability, conditional probability, independence, random variables, jointly distributed rvs, probability mass functions, probability density functions, expectations, the law of large numbers, central limit theorem).
